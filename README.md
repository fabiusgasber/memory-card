# 🧠 Memory Card Game

> A simple but challenging memory game built with React.

This project is part of [The Odin Project's React curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card#project-solution).

**Memory Card** is a React application that fetches player data from the public ESPN NFL API.  
The user must click on each card **only once** — clicking a card twice resets the current score and card deck. If the current score exceeds the previous high score, it updates accordingly.
